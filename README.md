# Cracking the Code: My LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode playground! This repository is where I tackle coding challenges, experiment with algorithms, and push my problem-solving skills to the limit.  
I will first go through the brute force approach and then dive into further optimising the code.
Think of it as a coding dojo where I sharpen my tools and share my techniques with fellow warriors.

## What You'll Find Inside

* **Concise Solutions:**  No fluff, just clean and efficient code in multiple languages. I wil be preferring Python3 as well as Java.
* **Crystal-Clear Explanations:**  Detailed comments that break down the logic, making it easy to understand even the trickiest algorithms.
* **Performance Insights:**  Time and space complexity analysis to help you grasp the efficiency of each solution.
* **Real-World Connections:**  Where relevant, I'll connect LeetCode problems to real-world applications and scenarios.

## Explore the Challenges

* **Arrays & Strings:**  Mastering the fundamentals. I will be doing problems related to recursion and backtracking, algorithms such as Flyods cycle detetction algorithm etc.
* **Linked Lists:**  Navigating the chains 
* **Trees & Graphs:**  Branching out and connecting the dots 
* **Dynamic Programming:**  Breaking down problems and conquering them
* **And More!**  Stay tuned as I continue to expand my LeetCode repertoire.

## Join the Coding Adventure

i have currently solved more than 30+ problems and trust me, it gets easier as we move ahead.
